    "Ruby": `Ruby is a transparent variety of crystalline corundum with reddening trace of chromic oxide. Ruby is
    red in colour with a hardness of 9. It is found in Brazil, Burma, Thailand and Srilanka. Ruby is

    you can decide to use Garnet, which is a semi precious stone.`,
    "Pearl": `Pearl is an organic substance, the hardened secretions of certian varieties of shelled molluses like
    oysters. It is found in Pacific and Indian oceans. Pearls are also produced by culturing. Although
    cultured pearls usually look more uniform in shape and better in colour often they are not as good as
    natural pearls. Pearl is governed by Moon. It is a cool gem. Opal, which is a semi precious stone can
    be used as a substitute for Pearl, if you so desire.`,
    "Yellow Sapphire": `Sapphire is a variety of corundum and is found in different colours. Sapphire of yellow or golden
    colours are ruled by Jupiter. It has a hardness of 8. Yellow Sapphire is found in Srilanka, India,

    Occurs in Australia, Brazil, Columbia, Norway and Urals. It is precious stone ruled by Mercury. It

    `,
    "Diamond": `Diamond is a precious stone. It is crystalline carbon. Hardness is 10. Occurs in South Africa, India,
    Brazil, Syberia, Urals and Sierra Leone. Diamond is found in different shades and colours. Usually

    some one close to you. Diamond is ruled by Venus. It releases indigo blue cosmic rays and is a cold
    gem.
    `,

    hardness of 9. Occurs in Burma, Srilanka, Kashmir and Australia. Planet connected with Blue

    variety is vivid red. Occurs in Pacific and Indian oceans. Red coral is governed by planet Mars. It
    filters off the malefic rays of Mars and permits only the rays which are beneficial to you. It is a hot
    gem.`
